# CSS Live Coding Challenge 20 March 2020

Today I decided to ask other to challenge me to some CSS Shenanigans!

## Topics Discussed

1. The first thing we started with was having a footer pushed to the bottom of the screen, even when the main content was short enough that it wouldn't. You'll have to either comment out or delete most of the main content to see it in action
1. Next up, we made a "flex-gap" where flex items have a consistent gap between each element, both horizontally and vertically
1. After that, a short "transition height"
1. "Zoom in" on an image that has a caption (and change the caption background) on hover
